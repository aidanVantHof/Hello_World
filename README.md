# Hello_World
Skills Lab Practice


The purpose of this software is to create a full name out of a first name String and a last name String.

This software takes in a first name and a last name and then proceeds to concatenate the two names and print out the full name.
It does this by asking for an input of a string variable for a first name and an input of a string variable for the last name.


If someone wanted to contribute to this software, they can download the Hello_World github file and push their changes from JupyterLab to gitHub.

This example shows how the user would be prompted for a first name as well as the first name being printed out.
```python
first = input("Enter a first name:")

print(first)
```
